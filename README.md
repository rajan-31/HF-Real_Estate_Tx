# Blockchain-Based Web Framework for Real Estate Transactions

This repo contains source code for the project "[Blockchain-Based Web Framework for Real Estate Transactions](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3035-5_44)".

__The research paper was presented in [ICCNCT 2022](http://icocnct.com/2022/), and it later got published in Springer, see [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3035-5_44).__

As the project was developed progressively in independent parts which were later integrated, in this repo those parts are included as git sub modules.

### Abstract

The onset of blockchain generation within Bitcoin has generated significant interest by showing an opportunity to eliminate the middle ground need and transform communication between people and machines by increasing trust. Initially restricted to the integrated currency domain, people began to see the power of a generation beyond just the cryptocurrencies, which brought the acceptance of the blockchain era to erase the world’s problems. One such situation is problems for e-governance companies in other areas of the public sphere. In the scope of this thesis, we have specifically addressed the issues within the traditional property registration system. This thesis discusses the new design and architecture for real estate transactions and implements it using a blockchain-based solution and addressing issues including record integrity, privacy, and most importantly the lack of common platforms among concerned government organizations. The advent of the blockchain era led to the creation of blockchain-enabled platforms like Hyperledger Fabric. It is one of the most popular open-source permissioned blockchain frameworks, created and supported by the Linux Foundation and IBM, used in many industrial scenarios. So, it is used to create a network with one ordering organization with an ordering node and one peer organization with two peer nodes to prove the concept. Chaincode similar to Ethereum’s smart contract contains the logic to perform all operations and modify the ledger data. All the methods of chaincode are accessed using the Fabric gateway in the web application to perform various operations.
